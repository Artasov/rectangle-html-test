# Rectangle HTML Test
Testing your skills in placing html elements.

## Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Artasov/rectangle-html-test
   ```
   
## Open `index.html` and `css/style.css`

## Task
   Just fill in the contents of the `<div class="o">` tag 
   in `index.html` , so that it looks like in the picture below.<br>
   Do not delete or change anything that is already in the 
   `index.html` and `style.css`, just add your code to them.<br>
   You can write new tags only inside a `div` with an `o` class tag.<br>
   Use only the `div` tags. <br>
   Do as much as you can, it's just a test *🙄*
## Difficulty Levels
  * ### `1` 🤓 Very simple
     Just make it like the image below.
  * ### `2` 😐 A bit complicated
     **Do not use**
     * justify-content
     * padding
  * ### `3` 🧐 Average
     When the width and height of the `.o` class are proportionally changed,
     its contents should not be distorted or change their proportions. 
     **Do not use**
     * `px em rem vh vw...` only `%`
     * margin
     * padding
  * ### `4` 😎 Difficult `Not really`
     **Do not use**
     When the width and height of the `.o` class are proportionally changed,
