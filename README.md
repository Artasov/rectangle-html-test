# Rectangle HTML Test
Testing your skills in placing html elements.

## Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Artasov/rectangle-html-test
   ```
   
## Open `index.html` and `css/style.css`

## Task
   Just fill in the contents of the `<div class="o">` tag 
   in `index.html` , so that it looks like in the picture below.<br>
   Do not delete or change anything that is already in the 
   `index.html` and `style.css`, just add your code to them.<br>
   You can only write new tags inside a `div` with an `o` class tag.<br>
   Use only the `div` tags. <br>
   Do as much and as much as you can, it's just a test *ðŸ™„*
